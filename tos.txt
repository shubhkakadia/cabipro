Terms of Service — CabiPro

Last Updated: [insert date]

Welcome to CabiPro.

CabiPro (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides software designed to help cabinet manufacturing businesses manage jobs, materials, production, suppliers, and operations.

By accessing or using CabiPro, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
If you do not agree, you must not use the platform.

These Terms operate alongside our Privacy Policy.

1. Who May Use CabiPro

To use CabiPro, you must:

be at least 18 years old

have the authority to enter agreements on behalf of your business

provide accurate information when creating your account

keep your login credentials secure

You are responsible for all activity performed under your account.

If we believe your account is being misused, accessed fraudulently, or violates these Terms, we may suspend or restrict access.

2. Your Account & Responsibilities

You agree to:

keep account details accurate and up to date

maintain the confidentiality of passwords

ensure only authorised people in your business access your account

use the platform in accordance with applicable laws

You must not:

attempt to hack, bypass security, or interfere with systems

misuse the service for unlawful or harmful activities

upload malicious files or code

resell, distribute, or clone the platform

reverse-engineer CabiPro

You remain responsible for all content your business uploads into the system.

3. Business Data Ownership

Everything you upload into CabiPro — including customer details, supplier data, production records, materials, drawings, files, and project notes — remains your business data.

We do NOT claim ownership over your operational data.

We only process this data to:

provide and maintain the service

troubleshoot issues

improve stability and security

comply with legal obligations

We will never sell your operational data.

If your subscription ends, you may request a copy of your data before deletion (unless prohibited by law).

4. Software Licence

We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use CabiPro for your internal business operations only.

You may not:

rent, lease, or sublicense CabiPro

incorporate it into another product

modify or build competing services using it

share access with external third parties without consent

All software, interfaces, and content created by CabiPro remain our intellectual property.

5. Subscription Plans & Billing

CabiPro operates on a subscription basis.

5.1 Payments

Plan pricing, billing frequency, and user limits are shown on our pricing page.
By subscribing, you authorise us or our payment partners to charge applicable fees.

Payments are:

due in advance

non-refundable except as required by law

If payment fails, we may suspend access until resolved.

5.2 Trials & Promotions

Free trials may be offered.
Trials convert to paid plans unless cancelled before the trial ends.

We may change plan features or pricing with reasonable notice.

5.3 Taxes

Prices may exclude local taxes, duties, or GST unless otherwise stated.
You are responsible for applicable taxes based on region and business registration.

6. Cancellation & Termination
6.1 You may cancel anytime

You can cancel your subscription through your account or by contacting us.
Cancellation stops future billing — but does not issue refunds for prior periods unless legally required.

6.2 We may suspend or terminate accounts if:

Terms are violated

unlawful or fraudulent activity occurs

non-payment continues

system misuse puts others at risk

Where reasonable, we will notify you first.

7. Service Availability & Updates

We aim to provide CabiPro reliably and continuously, but:

occasional downtime may occur for maintenance

we may update features, interfaces, or integrations

some legacy features may be discontinued if necessary

We will take reasonable steps to minimise disruption.

8. Support

Support may be provided by email, in-app, or other channels depending on your plan level.

We aim to respond promptly, but response times may vary.

9. Third-Party Services & Integrations

CabiPro may integrate with third-party tools (e.g., email services, accounting tools, storage providers).

We are not responsible for:

failures caused by external providers

loss arising from changes made to integrations outside our control

Use of third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies.

10. Security

We use reasonable technical, physical, and administrative measures to protect data.

However, no system is completely secure.

You acknowledge:

we cannot guarantee absolute protection against cyber threats

you are responsible for secure passwords and authorised access

you must notify us immediately if you suspect a breach

We comply with Australia’s Notifiable Data Breaches scheme and will notify affected users where legally required.

11. Warranties & Disclaimers

CabiPro is provided “as is” and “as available”.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee that:

the platform will be free from errors or interruptions

all features will meet every business need

integrations or external systems will always operate consistently

We provide tools — business decisions remain your responsibility.

Nothing in this section limits consumer rights under Australian Consumer Law.

12. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law:

we are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses

we are not responsible for loss of profits, data, or business interruption

total liability for any claim is limited to the subscription fees paid in the previous 12 months

This does not exclude liability where it cannot be excluded under law.

13. Australian Consumer Law (ACL)

Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law.

If services fail to meet statutory guarantees, you may be entitled to remedies including repair, replacement, refund, or compensation — depending on the circumstances.

14. Intellectual Property

All CabiPro branding, software code, design, content, and documentation are owned by us or licensed appropriately.

You may use them as part of the subscription — but cannot copy, reproduce, or exploit them without permission.

15. Confidentiality

We agree to treat your data as confidential.
You agree not to disclose pricing, system internals, or proprietary information shared during onboarding or support except as required by law.

16. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms periodically.

When changes are significant, we will provide reasonable notice.
Continued use of CabiPro after updates means you accept the revised Terms.

17. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Australia.
Any disputes will be handled within the appropriate courts or tribunals in Australia.
